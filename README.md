# News Site
The assignment was to develop a news website on a topic of our choice, and I decided to focus on fitness. The purpose of this assignment was to implement what I’ve learned about Flexbox and CSS Grid, so the focus was not primarily on the content of the articles.

I started by planning the structure of the website, sketching out a layout for each device — mobile, tablet, and desktop. Additionally, collecting different news articles that I could implement. 

If I had more time, I would have focused on improving the navigation bar by adding a menu button for mobile devices, rather than displaying all the links upfront.
